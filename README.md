# Capstone_2

This Capstone 2 project consists of showing our knowledge and skills of what we learned the past 4 weeks in Python, Numpy, and Matplotlib. All of my work was done in Jupyter Notebook for this project.

This is a two part project:

<ins>First part: Customer List Cleanup</ins>

We were provided with a dataset file: customer_list_updated.csv to cleanup the data. I made two files from this: customer_list_ready.csv and customer_list_cleaned.csv.

I created the customer_list_ready.csv file after cleaning it enough to import into a dataframe smoothly since it was using pipes instead of commas and the original file was causing issues upon importing it. 

After importing the file I created into a dataframe and cleaning up the data using Python, Numpy, and pandas, I exported the cleaned file as customer_list_cleaned.csv. 

<ins>Second part: Transactional Analysis<ins>

For this portion of the project, we were given a data set file: transaction_data.csv, to perform analysis on. 
I used Python, pandas, and matplolib to present the dataframe, showing sample of top 10 rows, and including a dataframe description. 

I also provided additional insights generated using aggregation / statistical functions. 
I ended the analysis by showing what information I gathered about quarterly sales into a data plot
